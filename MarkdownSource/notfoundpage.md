Not found (404) page
====================

`Docnet` will automatically create a not found (404) page in the root of the destination folder named `404.htm`.

If no `404.md` file is found in the root of the source folder, the file will be generated with default content. If a file is found, the `404.md` will be used to generate the not found (404) page.
